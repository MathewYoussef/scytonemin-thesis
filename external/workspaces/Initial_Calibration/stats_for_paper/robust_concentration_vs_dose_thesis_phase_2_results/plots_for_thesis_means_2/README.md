# Thesis Means Plot Suite

All nine plots described in `plot_plan.md` are generated by `generate_plots.py` and written to the local `build/` folder.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`

## Usage

```bash
python generate_plots.py
```

Outputs:

- `dose_trajectories.png` — trimmed-mean dose trajectories with 95 % CIs.
- `sequential_deltas.png` — dose-to-dose trimmed-mean deltas with CI whiskers.
- `replicates_vs_trimmed.png` — replicate jitter vs trimmed means for totals.
- `cross_assay_concordance.png` — Chrom vs DAD scatterplots with Deming fits.
- `uv_regime_context.png` — UVA/UVB intensities alongside Chrom totals/reduced pools.
- `reduced_vs_oxidized.png` — reduced and oxidized trajectories per assay.
- `peak_comparison.png` — peak windows and adjacent-dose values.
- `quadratic_fit_diagnostics.png` — quadratic fits highlighting concavity.
- `uva_trend_regressions.png` — UVA regressions with slope/R² annotations.

All figures land in `build/`, which stays inside the repository for reproducibility.
