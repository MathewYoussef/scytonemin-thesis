# Statistical Journey Figure Captions

All figures are generated by running `python3 figures_journey/generate_figures.py`, which reads the datasets in this folder and writes the PNG files alongside this markdown. Run the script in a writable environment to materialise the graphics.

- **Figure 1 — Replicates vs. Trimmed Means (`figure1_replicates_vs_trimmed.png`)**  
  Scatter the individual chromatogram and DAD replicate concentrations (n = 5 per dose) with jitter, overlaying the 20 % trimmed mean and its 95 % bootstrap CI. Demonstrates how robust averaging collapses variance while preserving dose ordering.

- **Figure 2 — Dose Trajectories (`figure2_dose_trajectories.png`)**  
  Line plots of trimmed means for totals, oxidized, and reduced pools across UVA doses for chromatogram and DAD assays. A dashed vertical line marks dose₅, reminding readers that UVB only drops between doses₅ and ₆; annotations call out the rise through dose₄, the dip at dose₅, and the smaller step at dose₆ (rebound for totals, decline for reduced pools).

- **Figure 3 — Weighted UVA Trends (`figure3_weighted_trends.png`)**  
  Scatter-and-fit panels for totals and reduced pools showing weighted least-squares regressions of trimmed means against UVA. Slopes reported in the legend connect visual trend strength to the statistics in `dose_trend_stats.csv`.

- **Figure 4 — Sequential Dose Deltas (`figure4_dose_deltas.png`)**  
  Bar charts of bootstrap-estimated dose-to-dose changes (with 95 % CIs) for totals and reduced fractions, highlighting the `+ + + − +` pattern for totals, the `+ − + + −` pattern for reduced pools, and the strong first jump that dominates the intervals.

- **Figure 5 — Assay Concordance (`figure5_assay_concordance.png`)**  
  Chromatogram vs. DAD trimmed means for totals, oxidized, and reduced fractions with Deming regression overlays. Validates that both assays tell the same story once replicates are collapsed.

- **Figure 6 — Trimmed Mean Sensitivity (`figure6_trimmed_mean_sensitivity.png`)**  
  Leave-one-out diagnostics plotting how trimmed means shift when each replicate is omitted. The spread of the amber points around the blue baseline underscores small-sample fragility of the robust means.
