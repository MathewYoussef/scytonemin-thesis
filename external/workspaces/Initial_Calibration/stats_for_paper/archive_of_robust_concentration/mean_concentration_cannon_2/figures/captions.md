# Figure Captions

1. **Figure 1 – Replicate Spread vs. Robust Dose Means:** Each dose’s five replicates (jittered points) are overlaid with the 20 % trimmed mean ± 95 % bootstrap CI for chromatogram and DAD totals, with numeric mean/CI callouts per dose to show the variance collapse and the rise through dose₄/₅ followed by a late dip.
2. **Figure 2 – Robust Mean Trajectories:** Trimmed means and confidence ribbons for chromatogram and DAD total/oxidized/reduced fractions across UVA, annotated with dose-endpoint values plus slope±SE and R² from the weighted UVA regressions (`dose_trend_stats.csv`) to emphasise the “mostly increasing with a late dip” pattern.
3. **Figure 3 – Sequential Dose Deltas:** Waterfall bars with bootstrap CIs and inline numeric intervals for changes between adjacent doses, noting the `+ + + − +` signature for totals and the `+ − + + −` signature for reduced pools that motivates the quadratic term.
4. **Figure 4 – Weighted UVA Trend Fits:** Linear weighted least-squares regressions of trimmed means versus UVA (matching `dose_trend_stats.csv`) with confidence bands, slope±SE, 95 % CI, p-value, and R² annotations to show the directionally positive but exploratory trends for totals and reduced pools; quadratic overlays remain summarised in Figure 3/Table `dose_pattern_summary.csv`.
5. **Figure 5 – Chromatogram vs. DAD Concordance:** Scatterplots with identity and Deming-regression lines reporting Pearson/Spearman correlations and Deming slope/intercept CIs, demonstrating near-unity agreement between assays at the dose-mean level for total and reduced pigment.
6. **Figure 6 – Replicate-Level Kendall τ Matrix:** Heatmap of Kendall τ (with p-values) for all pigment metrics against UVA and UVB, contrasting the modest replicate-level order signal with the stronger robust-mean trends.
