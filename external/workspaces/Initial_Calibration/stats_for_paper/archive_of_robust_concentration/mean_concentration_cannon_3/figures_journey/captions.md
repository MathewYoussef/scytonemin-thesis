# Figure Captions — Dose-Level Robust Mean Journey

1. **fig1_replicate_stripplots.png** — Replicate-level scatter (jittered) for chrom/DAD totals and reduced pools, with 20 % trimmed mean ± 95 % bootstrap CI overlaid to reveal the central tendency used in subsequent analyses.
2. **fig2_trend_lines.png** — Trimmed means versus UVA with weighted linear fits, illustrating how collapsing replicates exposes positive dose–concentration slopes and a mid-dose softening (dose₄→dose₅) captured by the quadratic term in `dose_pattern_summary.csv`. The callout marks the subsequent UVB decrease (dose₅→dose₆), which aligns with a small rebound in totals but a decline in reduced pools.
3. **fig3_sequential_deltas.png** — Bootstrap dose-to-dose changes for totals and reduced pools, highlighting the `+ + + − +` pattern for totals, the `+ − + + −` pattern for reduced pools, and the uncertainty intervals on each step.
4. **fig4_chrom_dad_concordance.png** — Dose-level agreement between chromatogram and DAD assays, showing proximity to the 1:1 line and Deming regression fits for totals and reduced fractions.
5. **fig5_analysis_flow.png** — Schematic of the statistical journey from replicate-level null results through the robust-mean hypothesis to the actionable dose-level trend used for downstream reflectance modelling.
