# Validation Panel Summary

| group_id | treatment | sample | angle | spectra_count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| treatment_3/sample_J/12Oclock | treatment_3 | sample_J | 12Oclock | 300 |
| treatment_5/sample_H/6Oclock | treatment_5 | sample_H | 6Oclock | 300 |
| treatment_6/sample_I/6Oclock | treatment_6 | sample_I | 6Oclock | 150 |

Total spectra: **750** (≈ 6.8 % of the 11 100-spectrum corpus).

Selection rationale:
- `treatment_5/sample_H/6Oclock` — hard case represented in folds 01 and 05.
- `treatment_3/sample_J/12Oclock` — easier regime aligned with the strong fold 02 performance.
- `treatment_6/sample_I/6Oclock` — zero-dose control retained as the gold-standard reference.
