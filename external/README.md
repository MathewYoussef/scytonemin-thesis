# External Workspaces

Legacy working directories copied verbatim from in-progress research repos. They are preserved for reference but are not part of the reproducible thesis pipeline.

- `workspaces/Act_of_God_Mamba_Results/`
- `workspaces/Reflectance/`
- `workspaces/Initial_Calibration/`
- `workspaces/Supplements/`

All raw inputs required for regeneration live under `data/raw/**`, and all scripts used in the reproducible pipeline have been refactored into `src/**`. Refer to the resource map at `ops/output/data/uplc_resource_map.md` before touching these archives.
