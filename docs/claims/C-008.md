# Claim C-008 — Gate 4 (Downstream proxy) PASS with improvements

## Thesis/Repo Context

> Gate 4 checks a downstream proxy: replicate variance reduction, separability ratio ≥ baseline, and dose monotonicity preserved. AoG artifacts report a PASS for Gate 4 with improvements across these metrics.

- Readiness description: `Act_of_God_Mamba_Results/README.md:35`
- Pipeline: `Act_of_God_Mamba_Results/scripts/downstream_proxy_eval.py`
- Audit summary: `Act_of_God_Mamba_Results/final_analytics/panel_eval/README_audit.md:21`

## Reported Metrics (from audit outputs)

- Replicate variance: 2.92×10⁻⁵ → 1.38×10⁻⁵ (52.6% reduction)
- Separability ratio: 21.30 → 30.34 (Δ = 9.04)
- Dose monotonicity: intact (median Δρ = 0, improved ratio = 1.0)

## Evidence Checklist

- Notebook cell: `mamba_ssm/notebooks/downstream_proxy.ipynb#cell-summary` (planned)
- Rendered table: `scaffold/mamba_ssm/tables/downstream_proxy_metrics.csv` (planned)
- Processed data: `data-processed/mamba_ssm/downstream_metrics.json @ <sha256>` (planned)
- Source code: `Act_of_God_Mamba_Results/scripts/downstream_proxy_eval.py @ <commit>`
