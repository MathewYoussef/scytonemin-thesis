# Claim C-001 — ORS maps Martian geology

## Thesis Excerpt (thesis.docx.md:9)

> “Beyond Earth, optical remote sensing (ORS) has been instrumental in mapping Martian mineralogy, sedimentary deposits, geological structures, and paleo‑aqueous environments (Murchie et al., 2007; Poulet et al., 2005; Ehlmann et al., 2008).”

## Evidence Checklist

- Notebook cell: TBD (context/background; no computation required)
