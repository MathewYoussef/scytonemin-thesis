# Claim C-010 — Adequacy despite gate failures (coverage, separability, monotonicity)

## Thesis Excerpt (thesis.docx.md:217)

> “Mamba‑SSM did not pass all production‑readiness gates and is therefore not shippable as a default instrument pipeline denoiser. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this thesis, it is adequate, because: (i) coverage‑style tail reliability is high; (ii) downstream separability and dose monotonicity are preserved; and (iii) fundamentally, the increase in SNR provides a foundational spectra from which analytics can be based upon (figure 4).”
