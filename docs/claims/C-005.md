# Claim C-005 — Grid 3 delivered ~100% MDV UV‑B and ~110% MDV UV‑A

## Thesis Excerpt (thesis.docx.md:71–83)

> “Under the measured powers and these lamp times, Grid 3 delivered ~100 % MDV UV‑B and ~110 % MDV UV‑A by design; full mapping appears in table 1.”

## Evidence Checklist

- Notebook cell: `supplements/notebooks/dose_mapping.ipynb#cell-table1` (planned)
- Rendered table: `scaffold/supplements/tables/dose_schedule.csv` (planned)
- Processed data: `data-processed/supplements/dose_schedule.csv @ <sha256>` (planned)
- Source code: `Supplements/scripts/dose_mapping.py` (planned)
- Automated test: `tests/test_dosimetry.py::test_grid3_targets` (planned)

## Notes

- Reproduce Table 1 from machine‑readable inputs; confirm percent‑MDV calculations and hours × power × 3600 formulae.
