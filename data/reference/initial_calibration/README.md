# Initial Calibration — Canonical Tables & Configs

Authoritative calibration outputs and configuration files produced by Stage A/B of the chromatogram workflow. These files are regenerated by running `python -m chromatography.run_stage_a` followed by `python -m chromatography.run_stage_bc` with `analysis_config.yaml` as the control file.

## Key Files
- `analysis_config.yaml` / `analysis_config_no_blank.yaml` — pipeline configuration snapshots that point at the raw assets under `data/raw/initial_calibration/`.
- `calibration_*.json` and `standards_fitted_*.csv` — model parameters and standard fits for each scytonemin form.
- `chromatogram_derived_concentrations.csv`, `DAD_derived_concentrations*.csv` — per-sample concentration estimates before/after correction.
- `treatments_concentration_raw.csv`, `treatments_corrected_amounts.csv` — treatment-level aggregates after biomass normalisation.
- `total_vs_parts_*` — diagnostics ensuring oxidised/reduced sums match total scytonemin.

Regenerated tables should retain identical schema and ordering. Validate with the regression tests under `tests/chromatography` (to be added) when the pipeline wrapper is completed.
