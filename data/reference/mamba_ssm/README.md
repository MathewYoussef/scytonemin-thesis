# Mamba-SSM — Reference Tables & Manifests

Canonical manifests, metadata tables, and evaluation summaries required to audit the Act-of-God run. Generated by the CLI utilities under `src/mamba_ssm/` and the analytics scripts in `final_analytics/`.

## Key Files
- `metadata/` — dose features, sampling weights, and supplemental metadata referenced by training scripts.
- `validation_panel.csv` / `validation_panel_summary.md` — fixed hold-out panel definition with accompanying narrative.
- `train_manifest_summary.md`, `training_group_counts.md`, `cv_fold02_train_summary.md` — coverage audits from the original run.
- `manifests/` — per-fold train/val/test manifests for reproducible denoising and evaluation.
- `denoised_full_run.csv` — canonical export of the full-inference pass.

Use these files alongside the raw spectra and checkpoints to verify panel metrics and downstream proxies.
