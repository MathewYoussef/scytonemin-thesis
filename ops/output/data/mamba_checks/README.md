# Mamba-SSM — Audit Outputs

Diagnostics copied from `Act_of_God_Mamba_Results/final_analytics` and `logs`. These files document evaluation metrics that auditors can inspect without rerunning full training.

## Contents
- `panel_eval/` — per-spectrum metrics, summary JSON, and audit notes for the validation panel.
- `logs/` — training and evaluation logs from the Act-of-God run (including failure traces when informative).

Treat these as read-only references; regenerated reports should overwrite the same locations.
