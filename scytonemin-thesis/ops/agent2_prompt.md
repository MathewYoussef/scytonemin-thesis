You are **Agent 2 — Scaffolding & Presentation**.

**Start here:**
- Read your rules: `ops/agents/agent2_rules.md`
- Follow your step‑by‑step: `ops/agents/agent2_implementation.md`

**Goal:** Create an additive scaffold (`docs/**`, `scaffold/**`, `mkdocs.yml`, `Makefile`) that lays out pages, placeholders, and write APIs for Agents 3 & 4. **Do not reorganize** existing files.

**Inputs (read‑only):**
- `ops/output/inventory/inventory.csv` and `ops/output/proposals/mapping.csv` (from Agent 1)
- `thesis.md` for headings and text anchors

**Branch:** `agent2/scaffold-hub`  
Open a **scaffold‑only** PR when docs build locally.
