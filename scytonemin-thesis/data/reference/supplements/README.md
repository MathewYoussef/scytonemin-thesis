# Supplements — Reference Materials

Curated artefacts derived from the raw supplements inputs. These files are the ones we cite directly in the documentation.

- `Diffuser_plate_6_percent_thesis_2025.pdf` — certification letter for the 6 % diffuser plate (archived copy for reviewers).
- `HPLC Section.pdf` — formal HPLC method section extracted from lab SOPs.
- `Par schedule-4.pdf` — cleaned chamber schedule PDF used to cross-reference the UV layout.
- `UV_dose_Calcs-2.pdf` — finalised dose calculation worksheet confirming UVA/UVB energy per grid.
- `500x500mm, Wavelength 250-800nm Reflectivity 6%--Test Data(2025-07-10 02_33_18).xlsx` — manufacturer reflectivity sheet (kept here for easy download).
- `sorurce of truth for methods I did notes.pdf` — curated version of lab notes for thesis references.

Checksums are stored in `CHECKSUMS.sha256`. Any additional derived tables (e.g., cleaned dose schedules) should also land in this directory once produced by the supplements pipeline.
