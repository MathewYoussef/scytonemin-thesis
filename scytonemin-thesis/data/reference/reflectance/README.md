# Reflectance — Canonical Tables

Outputs from the reflectance harmonisation pipeline (`src/reflectance/build_canonical_dataset.py` and companions). These tables stitch the raw denoised spectra, concentration crosswalks, and dose metadata into reviewer-friendly CSVs.

## Key Files
- `canonical_dataset/` — bundle of canonical tables (dose summary, precision-weighted concentrations, manifests) regenerated by `build_canonical_dataset.py`.
- `Combined_Scytonemin_Concentrations.csv` — joined concentration table aligning chromatogram/DAD results with reflectance IDs.
- `reflectance_concentration_crosswalk.csv`, `crosswalk_missing_concentration_ids.csv` — mapping utilities for downstream joins.

Re-run the canonical builder after syncing raw assets to confirm these outputs and update checksums as needed.
