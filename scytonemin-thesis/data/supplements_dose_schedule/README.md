# UV Chamber Dose Schedule & Meter Calibrations

Calibration exports from `Supplements/July_26_2025_DOSE_SCHEDULE_UPDATED/Calibration_files`. These files describe the UV chamber schedule, meter calibrations, and dose conversions used to support the main experiments.

## Contents
- `chamber_dose_schedule.csv` — timestamped chamber power settings and integrated dose targets.
- `MDV_24h_average_power.csv` — averaged measurements from the MDV solar meter.
- `uva_calibrated.csv` / `uvb_calibrated.csv` — calibrated irradiance readings for UVA/UVB channels.

`schema.json` captures inferred column types; `provenance.yaml` links to the calibration scripts used to produce the exports.
