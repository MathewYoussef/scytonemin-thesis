  - step: extract_auc
    script: Initial_Calibration/Scripts/compute_dad_auc.py
    description: Integrates diode-array absorbance to derive band-specific AUC values.
  - step: calibrate_predictions
    script: Initial_Calibration/Scripts/predict_dad_concentrations.py
    description: Applies regression calibration from standards to predicted concentrations.
  - step: normalize_blanks
    script: Initial_Calibration/Scripts/normalize_dad_predictions.py
    description: Removes blank signals and normalizes concentrations by dry biomass.
notes: Regenerate by executing the stage pipeline (`run_stage_a.py` → `run_stage_bc.py`) inside `Initial_Calibration/Scripts` with the raw `DAD_RAW_FILES/` inputs.
