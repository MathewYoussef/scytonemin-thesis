| C-001 | Beyond Earth, optical remote sensing (ORS) has been instrumental in mapping Martian mineralogy, sedimentary deposits,  geological structures, and paleo-aqueous environments (Murchie et al., 2007; Poulet et al., 2005; Ehlmann et al., 2008). | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |
| C-002 | In Antarctica, *Nostoc*\-dominated mats are widespread in the wetted zones of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), where they play a significant role in primary production and biogeochemical cycling during brief seasonal melt periods, such as those associated with wetted moats, slow-flowing streams, and snow-edge habitats. | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |
| C-003 | Variation in UV dose among treatments was achieved by positioning thalli within pre-mapped columns of an irradiance grid, which provided spatially distinct exposure intensities (see *Dosimetry* for mapping methodology and percent-MDV calculations). | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |
| C-004 | The mapping instrument was a Solarmeter Model 5.0 (Total UV A+B), specified for 280–400 nm with 0–199.9 mW cm⁻² range and ±5 % accuracy (Solarmeter, n.d.; Forestry-Suppliers, n.d.). | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |
| C-005 | Under the measured powers and these lamp times, Grid 3 delivered \~100 % MDV UV-B and \~110 % MDV UV-A by design; full mapping appears in *table 1*. | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |
| C-006 | In contrast to earlier SSMs (e.g., S4), Mamba makes the state‑space parameters input‑dependent (“selective”), which improves modeling of information‑dense sequences. | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |
| C-007 | The model predicts a denoised estimate Ṙ from input *Rrel*, while DipAwareLoss refits a guarded baseline to both the prediction and target, subtracts it to obtain absorption depth profiles, and penalizes the resulting area, centroid, and depth mismatches, thereby steering the network to preserve those features under the locally fitted continuum. | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |

##### Variance and “dip behavior” (signs of under- or over-fitting)

Because the model is trained in a noise-to-noise setting, its output is effectively the average clean signal consistent with a given noisy measurement and its metadata. | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |
| C-010 | Nevertheless, for the purposes of this thesis, it is adequate, because: (i) coverage‑style tail reliability is high; (ii) downstream separability and dose monotonicity are preserved; and (iii) fundamentally, the increase in SNR provides a foundational spectra from which analytics can be based upon (*figure 4*). | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |
| C-011 | Colors show the change in robust signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), expressed in decibels using a median/MAD estimator; red tones indicate SNR gains, blue tones indicate losses. | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |
| C-012 | Right-margin values report each treatment’s mean ΔSNR inside the ROI (320-480), and rows are ordered by those in-band gains so higher improvements appear at the bottom. | notebooks/figXX_YYY.ipynb#cell-N | scytonemin-data/path/to.csv@<sha256> | scytonemin-analytics/path/to.py@<commit> | tests/test_xx.py |
