# Claim C-003 — Treatment UV dose varied by irradiance grid columns

## Thesis Excerpt (thesis.docx.md:45–63)

> “Variation in UV dose among treatments was achieved by positioning thalli within pre‑mapped columns of an irradiance grid, which provided spatially distinct exposure intensities (see Dosimetry for mapping methodology and percent‑MDV calculations).”

## Evidence Checklist

- Notebook cell: TBD (dose grid map → table 1 reproduction)
- Rendered figure/table: `scaffold/supplements/tables/dose_schedule.csv` (planned)
- Processed data: `data-processed/supplements/dose_schedule.csv @ <sha256>` (planned)
- Source code: `notebooks/supplements/dose_mapping.ipynb` (planned)
- Automated test: `tests/test_dosimetry.py::test_percent_mdv_ranges` (planned)

## Notes

- Table 1 in the manuscript summarizes UV‑A/UV‑B powers, hours, and derived %MDV by column. Agent 3 will publish a machine‑readable table with checksums.
