# Claim C-009 — Variance and “dip behavior” under noise-to-noise training

## Thesis/Repo Context

> Because the model is trained in a noise‑to‑noise setting, its output approximates the average clean signal consistent with a given noisy measurement and metadata. Excessively deep dips relax toward cohort averages; structured noise masquerading as bands is penalized via DipAwareLoss.
