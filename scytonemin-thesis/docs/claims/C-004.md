# Claim C-004 — Mapping instrument: Solarmeter Model 5.0

## Thesis Excerpt (thesis.docx.md:49–63)

> “The mapping instrument was a Solarmeter Model 5.0 (Total UV A+B), specified for 280–400 nm with 0–199.9 mW·cm⁻² range and ±5% accuracy (Solarmeter, n.d.; Forestry‑Suppliers, n.d.). Ground‑plane irradiance was mapped with only one source active at a time (UV‑A OFF when measuring UV‑B; UV‑B OFF when measuring UV‑A). Broadband readings were converted to band‑specific powers using the instrument’s response and the lamp spectra.”
