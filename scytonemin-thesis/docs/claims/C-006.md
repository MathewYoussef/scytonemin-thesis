# Claim C-006 — Mamba’s selective SSM preserves band morphology

## Thesis Excerpt (thesis.docx.md:180)

> “In contrast to earlier SSMs (e.g., S4), Mamba makes the state‑space parameters input‑dependent (‘selective’), which improves modeling of information‑dense sequences. The learned map behaves like a very long, data‑dependent convolution constrained by shape‑aware regularization in the ROI.”

## Evidence Checklist

- Notebook cell: `mamba_ssm/notebooks/denoise_demo.ipynb#cell-compare` (planned)
- Rendered figure/table: `scaffold/mamba_ssm/figures/ssm_compare_roi.png` (planned)
- Processed data: `data-processed/reflectance/demo_roi.csv @ <sha256>` (planned)
- Source code: `Act_of_God_Mamba_Results/src/...` (pointer; planned)
- Automated test: `tests/test_mamba_roi.py::test_roi_shape_preservation` (planned)

## Notes

- Tie the demo figure to continuum‑removed ROI overlays showing morphology preservation vs. baseline denoisers.
